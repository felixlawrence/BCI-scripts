# What is this?
This is a set of scripts to wrangle the BCI data and do some simple operations on it that are common enough to justify moving them out of an ipython notebook and into a python file.

Sorry folks, the BCI data is not included here. Get yer own copy!

# Testing
Simply run `nosetests` from this directory.
